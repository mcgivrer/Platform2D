# README

## Context

This Platform2D class is an optimized mono class 2D platform game framework bringing all the required basic features to
implement a very simple java game.

## Build

This project is free of any build tools but Java and Javac ! :)
A simple `build.sh` script is used to build java code, create a jar and an auto-runnable linux compatible script.

```bash
build.sh a
```

> [!TIP]
> You can use the `build.sh h` to get help on this script arguments.
> The produced build delivers a javadoc jar and sources._

## Execute

you can execute the produced jar with the following line :

```bash
build.sh r
```

or you can execute it from the java command:

```bash
java -jar target/platform2d-1.0.0.jar
```

or, if you are a linux based guy, or a Windows constrained developer, but using git-bash:

```bash
target/build/platform2d-1.0.0.run
```

## Contribute

If you want to bring your own knowledge, you can fork this repositotry and create some pull request proposal to add new
features or refactor things ;)

Keep in mind that this code required to be simple, compact and less than 3000 lines :)
